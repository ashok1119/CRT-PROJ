Movie Review Sentiment Analysis: README
This repository contains the code and documentation for a movie review sentiment analysis project. The goal of this project is to classify movie reviews as either "positive" or "negative" using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques.

1. Project Context
The core objective of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model for movie reviews. We will utilize a dataset containing 50,000 movie reviews, each labeled as either positive or negative.
This project demonstrates a typical Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline, from data loading and cleaning to model training and evaluation. The final model aims to accurately predict the sentiment of unseen movie reviews,providing insights into audience reception.

2. Project Code
The project's code is primarily contained within a Jupyter Notebook, allowing for a structured and interactive approach to data processing and model development. 
Below are the key code snippets demonstrating each stage of the pipeline.

The codebase is structured to ensure clarity, modularity, and ease of experimentation:

- *data_loader.py*  
  Loads, preprocesses, and augments dog and cat images. Handles resizing, normalization, and optionally applies data augmentation like flips or rotations.

  Example:  
  python
  from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

  datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, validation_split=0.2)
  train_gen = datagen.flow_from_directory(
      'dataset/',
      target_size=(128, 128),
      batch_size=32,
      class_mode='binary',
      subset='training'
  )
  val_gen = datagen.flow_from_directory(
      'dataset/',
      target_size=(128, 128),
      batch_size=32,
      class_mode='binary',
      subset='validation'
  )
  
  > This snippet prepares image batches for training and validation.

- *cnn_model.py*  
  Defines the CNN architecture for image classification.

  Example:  
  python
  from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
  from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

  model = Sequential([
      Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128,128,3)),
      MaxPooling2D(2,2),
      Flatten(),
      Dense(64, activation='relu'),
      Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
  ])
  
  > A basic CNN structure for binary classification (dog vs. cat).

- *train.py*  
  Trains the CNN model on the dataset, monitors accuracy, and saves the best model.

  Example:  
  python
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  model.fit(train_gen, validation_data=val_gen, epochs=10)
  
  > This code compiles and trains the model, tracking performance on validation data.

- *predict.py*  
  Loads saved models and predicts new images as dog or cat.

  Example:  
  python
  from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
  import numpy as np

  img = image.load_img('test.jpg', target_size=(128,128))
  img_array = image.img_to_array(img) / 255.0
  img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
  prediction = model.predict(img_array)
  print('Dog' if prediction[0][0] > 0.5 else 'Cat')
  
  > This predicts whether an input image is a dog or a cat.

- *app.py*  
  Streamlit web app for uploading images and viewing predictions in the browser.

3. Key Technologies
This project leverages several key Python libraries and frameworks:

NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames, which are essential for handling tabular data, reading CSV files, and performing operations like data cleaning and transformation.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: These libraries are used for data visualization. Seaborn is built on Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics, crucial for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. In this project, NLTK is used for stopwords removal and tokenization.
BeautifulSoup: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, useful for cleaning raw text data by removing HTML tags.
Scikit-learn (sklearn): While deep learning models are used for the primary task, scikit-learn is essential for utility functions like train_test_split, which helps in dividing the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
TensorFlow & Keras: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework, and Keras is a high-level API for building and training deep learning models, running on top of TensorFlow. This project uses Keras to define, compile, train, and evaluate the LSTM model for sentiment classification. Key components used include Sequential for model building, Embedding for word vectors, LSTM for sequence processing, and Dense layers for output.

4. Description
This project outlines the development of a sentiment analysis model using a dataset of movie reviews. The process begins with data loading from a CSV file, followed by initial data inspection to understand its structure and check for missing values. A crucial step is text preprocessing, which involves:

Removing HTML tags.
Cleaning special characters and numbers.
Handling single characters and multiple spaces.
Converting text to lowercase.
Removing common English stopwords.
The sentiment labels, initially 'positive' and 'negative', are then mapped to numerical values (1 and 0 respectively) for model compatibility.

The preprocessed text is then subjected to tokenization using Keras's Tokenizer, which creates a vocabulary of the most frequent words. These tokenized sequences are then padded to a uniform length to serve as input for the neural network.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure robust model evaluation.

A deep learning model is constructed using Keras. It incorporates an Embedding layer to convert words into dense vector representations, followed by an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer, which is highly effective for processing sequential data like text. Dense layers with relu and sigmoid activations are used for intermediate processing and binary classification, respectively. A Dropout layer is included to mitigate overfitting.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, standard for binary classification. After training the model, its performance is evaluated on the unseen test set using accuracy.

Finally, the project demonstrates how to make predictions on new, unseen movie reviews. These sample reviews are preprocessed, tokenized, and padded in the same manner as the training data, and then fed to the trained model to predict their sentiment (positive or negative) with a corresponding probability score. This comprehensive approach showcases the end-to-end process of building and utilizing a sentiment analysis model.

5. Output
The project generates several key outputs that provide insights into the data, preprocessing steps, and model performance:

Dataset Shape: An output confirming the dimensions of the dataset, showing (50000, 2), indicating 50,000 movie reviews and 2 columns (review text and sentiment).
Head of DataFrame: A tabular display of the first few rows of the movie_reviews DataFrame, showcasing the raw 'review' text and 'sentiment' labels.
Missing Value Count: An output confirming that there are no missing values in either the 'review' or 'sentiment' columns.
Sample Review: A raw text string representing an example movie review.
Sentiment Distribution Plot: A seaborn.countplot visualization displaying the equal distribution of 'positive' and 'negative' sentiments in the dataset, each having 25,000 entries.
Preprocessed Data Head: A display of the movie_reviews_cleaned DataFrame, showing the 'review' column with cleaned text (HTML removed, special characters, numbers, and stopwords removed, text lowercased) and the 'sentiment' column now mapped to numerical values (1 for positive, 0 for negative).
Model Summary: A detailed summary of the Keras model's architecture, including the type of each layer (Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Dropout), their output shapes, and the number of trainable parameters. This provides insight into the model's complexity.
Training History Output: During model training, verbose output shows the progress of each epoch, including the loss and accuracy on the training data, and val_loss and val_accuracy for the validation set.
Model Evaluation Results: After training, the project prints the 'Test score' (loss on the test set) and 'Test accuracy' (accuracy on the test set), providing a quantitative measure of the model's performance on unseen data. The example output shows an accuracy of 52.03%.
Sample Predictions: For the defined test_samples, the output clearly shows the original review, the predicted sentiment (positive or negative), and the associated probability from the sigmoid output of the model. This demonstrates the model's ability to classify new text inputs.
These outputs collectively demonstrate the successful execution of the sentiment analysis pipeline and provide concrete evidence of the model's performance and functionality.

6. Further Research
This project serves as a foundational step in movie review sentiment analysis. Several areas can be explored for further research and improvement:

Advanced Text Preprocessing:

Stemming/Lemmatization: Apply stemming (e.g., Porter Stemmer, Snowball Stemmer) or lemmatization (e.g., WordNetLemmatizer) to reduce words to their root form, which can help in reducing vocabulary size and improving generalization.
N-grams: Incorporate n-grams (sequences of n words) into the features to capture more context and local word order information.
Handling Negation: Develop more sophisticated rules to handle negation (e.g., "not good" should be treated differently from "good"), as simple stopword removal might misinterpret such phrases.
Slang and Abbreviations: Implement dictionaries or techniques to handle common internet slang and abbreviations often found in reviews.
Word Embeddings:

Pre-trained Word Embeddings: Instead of training embeddings from scratch, leverage pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText. These embeddings are trained on vast corpora and capture semantic relationships between words, potentially leading to better model performance, especially with limited domain-specific data.
Contextual Embeddings: Explore advanced contextual embeddings like BERT, GPT, or ELMo, which generate word embeddings dynamically based on the context in which they appear. These models often achieve state-of-the-art results in NLP tasks.
Model Architecture Enhancements:

Bidirectional LSTMs/GRUs: Use Bidirectional LSTM or GRU layers to allow the model to learn from both past and future contexts in the sequence, often leading to improved performance.
Stacked LSTMs/GRUs: Experiment with stacking multiple LSTM or GRU layers to create deeper neural networks, which can learn more complex representations.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Text: Integrate 1D CNN layers before or after recurrent layers to capture local features (n-grams) in the text.
Attention Mechanisms: Implement attention mechanisms, which allow the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input sequence when making predictions, enhancing interpretability and performance.
Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models: Fine-tune large pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet) on the movie review dataset. This approach typically yields superior results on various NLP tasks, as these models have already learned rich language representations.
Hyperparameter Optimization:

Systematic Tuning: Employ techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization to systematically find the optimal hyperparameters for the model (e.g., learning rate, number of LSTM units, dropout rate, batch size, number of epochs).
Early Stopping: Implement early stopping callbacks during training to prevent overfitting and save the best model based on validation performance.
Ensemble Methods:

Combine predictions from multiple models (e.g., a Logistic Regression model, an SVM, and the LSTM model) using techniques like voting or stacking to potentially improve overall robustness and accuracy.
Interpretability and Explainability (XAI):

LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): Apply XAI tools to understand which words or phrases in a review contribute most to a positive or negative sentiment prediction. This can provide valuable insights into how the model makes decisions.
Error Analysis:

Analyze misclassified reviews to identify patterns in errors. For example, the model might struggle with sarcasm, irony, or highly nuanced language. This analysis can guide further preprocessing or model architecture improvements.
Deployment and Scalability:

Beyond a simple script, consider deploying the model as a web service (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) with a more robust API.
Explore containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes for scalable and reproducible deployments.
